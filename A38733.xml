            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Philoſopher could not ſee a man unleſs he hear him ſpeak. <hi>Loquere ut videam;</hi> Speech is the Index of the Mind, and the Mind only diſcriminates the Man: For, although an <hi>Ideot</hi> who hath but the ſhape of a man, may with ſilence ſo hide his folly, that ſtrangers to his Manners cannot diſcern him from a Sophiſter; Yet, doubtleſs, Silence is the greateſt Enemy to Learning, the Grave wherein oblivion buries the Parts and Knowledg of the braveſt ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Learned <hi>Saluſt,</hi> from this takes his Exordium;
<pb facs="tcp:109502:3"/> 
               <hi>Omnes homines qui ſeſe ſtudent praeſtare caeteris animalibus, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ope niti decet, ne vitam ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia tranſeant, veluti pecora,</hi> Thoſe men who would excel Beaſts, ſhould labour that their lives might not paſſe in ſuch ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as Beaſts do. It ſeems he deemed, that man little inferior to a Beaſt, who acted nothing to prolong his Memory; For this he held to be the duty of every man, ſaying, <hi>Quo mihi rectius eſſe videtur, ingenii quàm virium opibus gloriam quaerere; &amp; quoniam vita ipſa, qua fruimur, brevis eſt, memoriam noſtri quàm maxime longam effiiere.</hi> In my opinion, 'tis far better, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Glory by the Riches of Wit, then ſtrength; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our lives are ſhort of themſelves, we ſhould indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by Ingenuity, to eternize their memory.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:109502:3"/>
            <p>And to effect this,<note place="margin">Nulla dies ſine linea.</note> 
               <hi>Nulla dies abeat, quin linea ducta ſuperſit;</hi> No day ſhould paſſe over our heads, wherein we ſhould not act ſome memorable exploit: Men ſhould not live like <hi>Snails,</hi> never ſtirring out of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but be active (I mean not buſie-bodies in other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but) in their own Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of which the wiſe <hi>Cato</hi> tells us, <hi>Every man ſhould give a reaſonable account;</hi> And if we believe the famous <hi>Seneca, Nihil eſt turpius quàm grandis natu ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex, qui nullum habet vitae ſuae argumentum, quo diu ſe vixiſse dicat, praeter aetatem.</hi> Nothing is more unworthy, than an old man, who hath nothing to ſhew for his Antiquity, but a Gray-Beard; who is no ſooner dead, than forgotten, long before he is half rotten; yet who is ſo apt to deride the Endeavors
<pb facs="tcp:109502:4"/> of other men, as this antient <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> whoſe wrinckles in his face, worn-out looks, and many years ſway more with the vulgar people, than all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Law or Reaſon: Had <hi>Seneca</hi> been ſuch a ſilent <hi>Momus,</hi> the World would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been bleſt, with his ſo learned Works. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, writing Books is needfull in no Science more, than in the Law; For without Books, how would the Lawyers do for Arguments at the Barr, or Reſolutions at their Chambers: Whence the Oracle Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> pronounces this, <hi>Omnes debere Juris-prudentiae libris com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponendis animum adjicere;</hi> That all men ought to addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Compoſing Books of Law; ſome to the Reporting of the Judgments and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Judges, who are
<pb facs="tcp:109502:4"/> 
               <hi>Lex loquens;</hi> and ſome to the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of theſe Caſes and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, methodizing, and fitting them for ſome particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as <hi>Littleton, Standford, Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert, Crumpton, Perkins, Finch,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed, moſt of the Law-Books extant, if not all, (ſetting aſide the Reports) are nothing elſe, but Collections out of others. This I ſpeak, not in derogation of them, in the leaſt; for as 'tis equally, if not more laborious; ſo 'tis full as glorious, Judiciouſly to cull out authentick Caſes, out of the Volumes of the Law (where ſo many are no Law), and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully place them in a particular Treatiſe, as 'tis to report the Judgements and Reſolutions from the mouth of the Court; for the Reporter is but the Courts Secretary, and <hi>Cook</hi>'s Inſtitutes merit as much as his
<pb facs="tcp:109502:5"/> Reports; And <hi>Aſh</hi>'s Tables, <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi>'s Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are as uſeful as the Year Books themſelves, of which kind of Collections, one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly thus breaks out, <hi>Quo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem beneficio, haud ſcio, aut aliud aut legum Candidatis magis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, aut Reipublicae magis commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, aut divini honoris illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis magis idoneum, vel cogitando quidem conſequi, quiſquam poterit.</hi> Then which benefit I know not, whether any man can even ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine another, either to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers more grateful, or to the Commonwealth more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or for the illuſtration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour more fit. For with the leaſt labour, a ſmall price, and little time, they preſent you with thoſe Reſolutions, and Judgments which lye ſcattered in the voluminous Books of the Law; which would otherwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:109502:5"/> coſt much time, pains and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to find out. The thoughts of which publick good, firſt gave life to theſe Endeavors of mine: Not that any one ſhould in the leaſt imagine, that I am ſo guilty of vain oſtentation, as to believe, that my Parts or Abilities can perform any thing in this kind, like other men: No, <hi>Ipſe mihi nunquam Judice me placui.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could never yet pleaſe my ſelf with my own labours, much leſſe are they worthy to pleaſe others, <hi>haud equidem tali me dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor honore.</hi> However, when I conſider, that no man hath yet written particularly concerning this Subject, and of what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall uſe it is, I doubt not, but that this Treatiſe will receive a favourable conſtruction from moſt men, and a plauſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation from others.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Uſe of the Book.</note>The uſe of it, is, in a manner, Epidemicall; ſince mens Lives and Eſtates are ſubject to that Tryall <hi>per Pais,</hi> here demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but in particular, the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers at Law, (eſpecially <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys, Solicitors, Clerks,</hi> &amp;c.) and all <hi>Jurors,</hi> (for whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections it is of ſingular uſe) are chiefly concerned herein.

For the Lawes being holy, it followeth, that the Miniſters, and ſetters forth of them, muſt be givers of holy things; and ſo by interpretation, doth <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos</hi> ſignifie; and doubtleſs, he which duly conſiders thoſe Rules of <hi>Theology,</hi> which lie ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered throughout the whole body of the Law, muſt needs conclude our Lawes to be Commentaries upon the Old and New Teſtament; and do ſo much bear the Image <hi>Legis Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae,</hi> that they may well be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Moſt High.</p>

            <p>And ſince <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is <hi>Ars or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate dicendi,</hi> and conſiſteth of thoſe two parts, <hi>Elocution,</hi> and <hi>Pronunciation.</hi>

                  <hi>Challenge</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Challenge.</note> is a word common as well to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as to the <hi>French,</hi> and ſometimes ſignifieth to claim, and the Latine word is <hi>vendicate;</hi> ſometime in reſpect of revenge to challenge into the field, and then it is called in Latine, <hi>vindicare</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocare;</hi> Sometime in reſpect of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality or inſufficiency, to challenge in Court perſons returned on a <hi>Jury.</hi> And ſéeing there is no proper Latin word to ſignifie this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar kind of Challenge, they have framed a word anciently written <hi>Chalumniare,</hi> and <hi>Columpniare,</hi> and <hi>Calumpniare,</hi> and now written <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare,</hi> and hath no affinity with the verbe <hi>Calumnior,</hi> or <hi>Calumnia,</hi> which is derived of that, for that is of a quite other ſenſe, ſignifying a falſe accuſer, and in that ſenſe, <hi>Bracton</hi> uſeth <hi>Calumniator</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calumniator.</note> to be a falſe accuſer: but it is derived of the old word <hi>Caloir,</hi> or <hi>Chaloir,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:109502:63"/> which in one ſignification is to care for, or foreſée. And for that to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>Jurors,</hi> is the mean to care for or foreſée, that an indifferent tryal be had, it is called <hi>Calumniare,</hi> to challenge, that is, to except againſt them that are returned to be <hi>Jurors,</hi> and this is his proper ſignification: But ſometimes a Sommons, <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitio</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Calumniata,</hi> and a Count to be challenged, but this is improperly. And foraſmuch as mens lives, Fames, Lands, and Goods, are to be tryed by <hi>Jurors,</hi> it is moſt neceſſary that they be <hi>Omni exceptione majo es,</hi> and therefore I will handle this matter the more largely.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Challenge is twofold.</note>A Challenge to <hi>Jurors</hi> is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either to the Array, or to the Polls: to the array of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Pannell,<note place="margin">To the Array.</note> and to the array of the <hi>Tales.</hi> And herein you ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the <hi>Jurors</hi> names are ranked in the Pannel one under another, which order or ranking the <hi>Jury</hi> is called the Array, and the Verbe, to array the <hi>Jury,</hi> and ſo we
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109502:63"/> ſay in common ſpéech, <hi>Battail array,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Array.</note> for the order of the battail. And this array we call <hi>Arraiamentum,</hi> and to make the array, <hi>Arrairare,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived of the French word <hi>Arroier;</hi> ſo as to challenge the array of the Pannel, is at once to challenge or except againſt all the perſons ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed or impannelled, in reſpect of the partiality or default of the Sheriff, Coroner, or other Officer that made the Return.</p>
               <p>And it is to be known,<note place="margin">Principall Challenges.</note> that there is a principal cauſe of challenge to the Array, and a challenge to the favour: principall, in reſpect of partiality, as firſt, if the Sheriff or other Officers be of kindred or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity to the Plaintiff or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, if the affinity continue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, If any one or more of the <hi>Jury</hi> be returned at the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the party, Plaintiff or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, the whole array ſhall be quaſhed. So it is if the Sheriff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn any one, that he be more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the one than to the other,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109502:64"/> all the array ſhall be quaſhed. Thirdly, if the Plaintiff or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant have an Action of Battery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sheriff, or the Sheriff againſt either party, this is a good cauſe of challenge. So if the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff or Defendant have an action of debt againſt the Sheriff, (but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is, if the Sheriff have an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of debt againſt either party) or if the Sheriff have parcel of the Land depending upon the ſame Title, or if the <hi>Sheriff</hi> or his <hi>Bayliff</hi> which returned the <hi>Jury,</hi> be under the diſtreſs of either party; or if the Sheriff or his Bayliff be either of Counſel, Atturney, Officer in fée, or of Robes, or ſervant of either party, Goſſip, or Arbitrator in the ſame matter, and treated thereof. And where a ſubject may challenge the array for unindifferency, there the King, being a party may alſo challenge for the fame cauſe, as for Kindred, or that he hath part of the Land, or the like; and where the array ſhall be challenged againſt the King, you ſhall read in our Books.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:109502:64"/>
               <p>By default of the Sheriff, as when the array of a Pannel is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by a Bayliff of a Franchiſe, and the Sheriff return it as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, this ſhall be quaſhed, becauſe the party ſhall loſe his challenges. But if a Sheriff return a Iury within a Liberty, this is good, and the Lord of the Franchiſe is driven to his remedy againſt him.</p>
               <p>If a Péer of the Realm,<note place="margin">Where there muſt be a Knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned of the Jury.</note> or Lord of Parliament be demandant or Plaintiff, Tenant or Defendant, there muſt a Knight be returned of his Iury, be he Lord Spiritual, or Temporal, or elſe the array may be quaſhed: but if he be returned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he appear not, yet the Iury may be taken of the reſidue. And if others be joyned with the Lord of Parliament, yet if there be no Knight returned, the array ſhall be quaſhed againſt all. So in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint, there ought to be a Knight returned to the Iury.</p>
               <p>And when the King is party,<note place="margin">Where the King is party.</note> as in travers of an Office, he that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109502:65"/> may challenge the array, as hereafter in this <hi>Section</hi> ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; And ſo it is in caſe of life: And likewiſe the King may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the array, and this ſhall be tryed by Tryors according to the uſuall courſe. The array challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides ſhall be quaſhed.</p>
               <p>And if two eſtrangers make a Pannel, and not in favourable manner for the one party, or the other, and the Sheriff returns the ſame, the array was challenged for this cauſe, and adjudged good.</p>
               <p>If the Bayliff of a Liberty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn any out of his Franchiſe, the array ſhall be quaſhed, as an array returned by one that hath no Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe ſhall be quaſhed.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109502:65"/> muſt be left to the diſcretion and conſcience of the Triors; as if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> be Tenant to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> this is no principall Challenge, for the Lord is in no danger of his Tenant, but <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo</hi> it is a principal Challenge; but in the other he may challenge for favour, and leave it to tryall. So affinity betwéen the Sonne of the Sheriff, and the Daughter of the party, or <hi>è converſo,</hi> or the like, is no principal challenge, but to the favour; but if the Sheriff marry the Daughter of either party, or <hi>e converſo,</hi> this (as hath béen ſaid) is a principall Challenge,<note place="margin">For the King.</note> or the like. But where the King is party, one ſhall not challenge the array for favour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his allegeance, he ought to favour the King more. But if the <hi>Sheriff</hi> be a Vadelect of the Crown, or other meniall ſervant of the King, there the challenge is good, and likewiſe the King may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the array for favour.</p>

               <p>And in 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 425. upon Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of many Authors, it is ſaid, That it hath béen reſolved, that in all Actions, reall, perſonall, and mixt, and upon all Iſſues joyned, generall or ſpeciall, the Iury might finde the ſpecial matter of fact, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and tending onely to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue joyned, and thereupon pray the diſcretion of the Court for the Law. And this the Iurors might do at Common Law, not onely in Caſes betwéen party and party, but alſo in Pleas of the Crown, at the Kings Suit, which is a proof of the Common Law. And the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> the 2d <hi>cap.</hi> 30. is but an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitive of the Common Law.</p>

As for example, ſaith <hi>Littleton, Sect.</hi> 366. 367, 368. Albeit a man cannot in any Action, plead a Condition, which toucheth and concernes a Fréehold,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109502:97"/> without ſhewing writing of this; yet a man may be ayded, upon ſuch a Condition, by the Verdict of 12. men, taken at large, in an <hi>Aſſize</hi> of <hi>Novel diſſeiſin,</hi> or in any other Action, where the Iuſtice will take the Verdict of 12. Iurors at large: As put the caſe, a man ſeized of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Land in Fée; letteth the ſame Land to another, for terme of life, without Déed, upon Condition to tender to the Leſſor, a certain Rent, and for default of payment, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By force whereof the Leſſée is ſeiſed as of Fréehold; and after, the Rent is behinde, by which the Leſſor entreth into the Land, and after the Leſſée arraign an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize of <hi>Novel diſſeiſin,</hi> of the Land againſt the Leſſor, who pleads that he did no wrong, nor <hi>Diſſeiſin.</hi> And upon this, an Aſſize is taken. In this caſe, the Recognitors of the Aſſize may ſay, and render to the Iuſtices, their Verdict at large, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter; as to ſay, that the Defendant was ſeized of the Land, in his Demeſne as of Fée,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109502:98"/> and ſo ſeized, let the ſame Land to the Plaintiff, for terme of his life, rendring to the Leſſor ſuch a yearly Rent payable at ſuch a Feaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vpon ſuch Condition, that if the Rent were behinde at any ſuch Feaſt, at which it ought to be paid, then it ſhould be lawfull for the Leſſor to enter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By force of which Leaſe, the Plaintiff was ſeized in his Demeſne, as of Frée-hold, and that afterwards, the Rent was behinde, at ſuch a Feaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which the Leſſor entred into the Land, upon the poſſeſſion of the Leſſée. And pray the diſcretion of the Iuſtices, if this be a Diſſeiſin done to the Plaintiff, or not. Then, for that it appeareth to the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that this was no Diſſeiſin to the Plaintiff, inſomuch, as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Leſſor was congeable on him, The Iuſtices ought to give Iudgement, that the Plaintiff ſhall not take any thing by his Writ of Aſſize, and ſo in ſuch caſe, the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor ſhall be ayded, and yet no Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was ever made of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109502:98"/> For as well as the Iurors may have Conuſance of the Leaſe, they alſo as well may have Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the Condition, which was declared and rehearſed upon the Leaſe.</p>
               <p>In the ſame mannor it is of a Feoffment in Fée, or a guift in tail, upon Condition, although no Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were ever made of it. And as it is ſaid of a Verdict at large, in an Aſſize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the ſame manner it is of a Writ of Entry, founded upon a Diſſeiſin, and in all other Actions, where the Iuſtices will take the Verdict at large, there where ſuch Verdict at large is made, the manner of the whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is put in Iſſue.</p>
